# Bootcamp Coding Repository

This repository serves as a collection of all projects, assignments, and learning materials from my coding bootcamp.

## Overview

This bootcamp was an intensive program designed to build full-stack development skills. The curriculum was divided into monthly modules, each focusing on different technologies and concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized chronologically by month:

### Bulan 1 (Month 1)

This folder contains all materials and assignments from the first month of the bootcamp. Topics covered during this month likely included:

*   **Dasar-dasar Web:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals.
*   **Version Control:** Introduction to Git and GitHub.
*   **ReactJS:** Building user interfaces with the React library.
    *   Assignments can be found in `Bulan 1/Reactjs/`
    *   Various JavaScript exercises and small projects are located in `Bulan 1/Tugas X/` (e.g., `Tugas 1`, `Tugas 4`, `Tugas 10`, etc.).
    *   Specific tasks include:
        *   `Tugas 1`: HTML form and data handling.
        *   `Tugas 2`: Portfolio website using HTML and CSS.
        *   `Tugas 3`: Responsive web design.
        *   `Tugas 4 - Tugas 12`: JavaScript exercises covering variables, operators, loops, functions, arrays, objects, callbacks, and promises.

### Bulan 2 (Month 2)

This folder contains all materials and assignments from the second month of the bootcamp. This month likely focused on backend development and more advanced topics:

*   **Node.js & Express.js:** Building server-side applications and APIs.
*   **Databases:** Working with SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and potentially NoSQL databases.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Implementing user login and security features (e.g., JWT).
*   **Full-Stack Integration:** Connecting frontend and backend applications.
    *   Assignments can be found in `Bulan 2/Tugas X/` and `Bulan 2/Quiz-1/`.
    *   Specific tasks include:
        *   `Tugas-1`: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript.
        *   `Tugas-2`, `Tugas-3`: Database design and SQL queries.
        *   `Tugas-4`, `Tugas-5`: Introduction to Node.js and Express.js.
        *   `Tugas-6`, `Tugas-7`: Building REST APIs with Express.js and database integration.
        *   `Tugas-8`: Full-stack project with a frontend and backend.
        *   `Tugas-9.1`, `Tugas-10`: Implementing JWT authentication.
        *   `Tugas-11`: API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI).
        *   `Quiz-1`: A quiz application likely involving Node.js, Express, and a database.

## Navigating the Repository

*   Each `Tugas X` folder within `Bulan 1` and `Bulan 2` corresponds to a specific assignment or topic.
*   Some assignment folders (e.g., `Bulan 1/Reactjs/newfile1`, `Bulan 2/Tugas-10`) are self-contained projects with their own `package.json` and dependencies. You may need to run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) within these directories if you intend to run them locally.
*   SQL files (`.sql`) contain database schemas or dumps related to specific assignments.
